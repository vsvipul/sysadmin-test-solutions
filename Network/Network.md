## 1. Github Webhooks


## 2. Domain Name
For this task, i used the **"Who is"** query command in terminal and used it for the domain ```iitmandi.ac.in``` of which ```students.iitmandi.ac.in``` is a subdomain.

```bash
whois iitmandi.ac.in
```

which gave the following output,

```txt
Domain ID:D4020030-AFIN
Domain Name:IITMANDI.AC.IN
Created On:02-Feb-2010 10:09:08 UTC
Last Updated On:23-Dec-2014 08:30:40 UTC
Expiration Date:02-Feb-2020 10:09:08 UTC
Sponsoring Registrar:ERNET India (R9-AFIN)
```

,which points out to the fact that <http://www.iitmandi.ac.in> was bought from **ERNET India**, which has been appointed as an exclusive domain registrar for the education and research domains registering the domains under the .in registry from 2005 It registers Domains at second and third level for ac.in, edu.in and res.in zones.

So, **ERNET India** should have registered the subdomain  ```students.iitmandi.ac.in``` also.
